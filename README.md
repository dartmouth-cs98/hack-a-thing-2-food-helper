# hack-a-thing food-helper
### This project will explore an idea during an interview about building a calorie and meal planning app for new young adults starting with recepies

## Purpose 
- Help young working professionals manage food
- Provide ready receipies that people can use

##App Inspiration
- Interview with Alum about how hard it is to have to learn to find time to cook meals and learn cooking now that she lives along
- Never touched any kind IOS or mobile development ever before, but there's so many cool ideas that work better with mobile interaction, so I really wanted to try iOS

## Design/Build Attempt Idea
### Will be trying to build and iOS app that will pull recepies

## Functionality
1.  For now just have a recepie uploading where you can put pictures of meals and rate them

## Stretch functionality for expensions
- A list view of all foods
- Build calories counting for recepies
- Builds grocery list off of selected recepies of the week
- Being able to remove recpieces with foods you dislike or are allergic too
- Recommended recepies???

##What I learned
- Apple has a lot of cool tools that are avaliable in the object library
- Xcode has alot of moving parts and the initial learning curve is really high


##What didnâ€™t work
- I tried a little customization and wen back because it's very hard to do well
- Struggled alot with a "Thread 1: signal SIGABRT" thread since I had no idea how to decode in xcode -> in the end it was a simple typo



##Tutorials/Resources
- Most of the code to set up the extension was done following this tutorial: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1
- comments throughout the xcode is my reading through the tutorial and learning it
- help diagnose bug https://medium.com/@consbulaquena/fixing-thread-1-signal-sigabrt-error-in-ios-9a50a94368da
